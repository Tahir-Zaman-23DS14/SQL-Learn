# Main Idea Working With SQL



Database = A place where data is stored in an organized way.
→ Example: tables with rows and columns.

SQL (Structured Query Language) = A language used to communicate with the database.
→ Used to insert, read, update, and delete data.

DBMS (Database Management System) = Software that creates, manages, and controls the database.
→ It allows users to use SQL, keeps data secure, and handles multiple users.

So the full picture is:

User → SQL → DBMS → Database
