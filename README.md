# Main Idea Working With SQL


Server = A powerful computer
→ Where everything runs and data is physically stored

Database = Organized data
→ Tables, rows, and columns
→ Data lives inside the server

DBMS (Database Management System) = Software
→ Runs on the server
→ Creates and manages the database
→ Controls security and users

SQL (Structured Query Language) = Language
→ Used to talk to the DBMS
→ Used to insert, read, update, delete data

User / Application = Person or program
→ Sends SQL commands

Complete Flow (Very Important)

User / App → SQL → DBMS → Database (on Server)

One-line memory trick

Server = Machine
Database = Data
DBMS = Manager
SQL = Language

This structure is clean enough for tests, strong enough for interviews, and accurate enough for real systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
