# Main Idea Working With SQL


1 Server = A powerful computer
→ Where everything runs and data is physically stored

2 Database = Organized data
→ Tables, rows, and columns
→ Data lives inside the server

3 DBMS (Database Management System) = Software
→ Runs on the server
→ Creates and manages the database
→ Controls security and users

4 SQL (Structured Query Language) = Language
→ Used to talk to the DBMS
→ Used to insert, read, update, delete data

5 User / Application = Person or program
→ Sends SQL commands
#
Complete Flow (Very Important)

User / App → SQL → DBMS → Database (on Server)
#
One-line memory trick

Server = Machine
<br>
Database = Data
<br>
DBMS = Manager
<br>
SQL = Language

This structure is clean enough for tests, strong enough for interviews, and accurate enough for real systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
